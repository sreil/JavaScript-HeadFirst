You can use a flowchart to outline the logic of a
JavaScript program, showing decision points and
actions.

Before you begin writing a program, it’s a good idea
to sketch out what your program needs to do with
pseudocode.

Pseudocode is an approximation of what your real code
should do.

There are two kinds of boolean operators: comparison
operators and logical operators. When used in an
expression, boolean operators result in a true or false
value.

Comparison operators compare two values and result
in true or false. For example, we can use the boolean
comparison operator < (“less than”) like this: 3 < 6. This
expression results in true.

Logical operators combine two boolean values. For
example true || false results in true; true && false results
in false.

You can generate a random number between 0 and 1
(including 0, but not including 1) using the Math.random
function.

The Math.floor function rounds down a decimal number
to the nearest integer.

Make sure you use Math with an uppercase M, and not
m, when using Math.random and Math.floor.

The JavaScript function prompt shows a dialog with
message and a space for the user to enter a value.

In this chapter, we used prompt to get input from the
user, and alert to display the results of the battleship
game in the browser.
