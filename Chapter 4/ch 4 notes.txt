Arrays are a data structure for ordered
data.

An array holds a set of items, each with its
own index.

Arrays use a zero-based index, where the
first item is at index zero.

All arrays have a length property, which
holds a number representing the number
of items in the array.

You can access any item using its index.
For example, use myArray[1] to access
item one (the second item in the array).

If an item doesn’t exist, trying to access it
will result in a value of undefined.

Assigning a value to an existing item will
change its value.

Assigning a value to an item that doesn’t
exist in the array will create a new item in
the array.

You can use a value of any type for an
array item.

Not all the values in an array need to be
the same type.

Use the array literal notation to create a
new array.

You can create an empty array with
var myArray = [ ];

The for loop is commonly used to iterate
through arrays.

A for loop packages up variable
initialization, a conditional test, and
variable increment into one statement.

The while loop is most often used when
you don’t know how many times you
need to loop, and you’re looping until a
condition is met. The for loop is most often
used when you know the number of times
the loop needs to execute.

Sparse arrays occur when there are
undefined items in the middle of an array.

You can increment a variable by one with
the post-increment operator ++.

You can decrement a variable by one with
the post-decrement operator --.

You can add a new value to an array using
push.
