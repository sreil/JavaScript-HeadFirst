The Document Object Model, or DOM, is
the browser’s internal representation of your
web page.
?
The browser creates the DOM for your page
as it loads and parses the HTML.
??You get access to the DOM in your
JavaScript code with the document object.
??
The document object has properties and
methods you can use to access and modify
the DOM.
??
The document.getElementById method
grabs an element from the DOM using its id.
??
The document.getElementById method
returns an element object that represents an
element in your page.
??
An element object has properties and
methods you can use to read an element’s
content, and change it.
??
The innerHTML property holds the text
content, as well as all nested HTML content,
of an element.
??
You can modify the content of an element by
changing the value of its innerHTML property.
??
When you modify an element by changing its
innerHTML property, you see the change in
your web page immediately.
??
You can get the value of an element’s
attributes using the getAttribute method.
??
You can set the value of an element’s
attributes using the setAttribute method.
??
If you put your code in a <script> element in
the <head> of your page, you need to make
sure you don’t try to modify the DOM until the
page is fully loaded.
??
You can use the window object’s onload
property to set an event handler, or callback,
function for the load event.
??
The event handler for the window’s onload
property will be called as soon as the page is
fully loaded.
??
There are many different kinds of events we
can handle in JavaScript with event handler
functions.
