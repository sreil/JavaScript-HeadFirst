Declare a function using the function
keyword, followed by the name of the
function.

Use parentheses to enclose any parameters
a function has. Use empty parentheses if
there are no parameters.

Enclose the body of the function in curly
braces.

The statements in the body of a function are
executed when you call a function.

Calling a function and invoking a function
are the same thing.

You call a function by using its name
and passing arguments to the function’s
parameters (if any).
A function can optionally return a value using
the return statement.

A function creates a local scope for
parameters and any local variables the
function uses.
Variables are either in the global scope
(visible everywhere in your program) or in
the local scope (visible only in the function
where they are declared).

Declare local variables at the top of the body
of your function.

If you forget to declare a local variable using
var, that variable will be global, which could
have unintended consequences in your
program.

Functions are a good way to organize your
code and create reusable chunks of code.

You can customize the code in a function by
passing in arguments to parameters (and
using different arguments to get different
results).
Functions are also a good way to reduce or
eliminate duplicate code.

You can use JavaScript’s many built-in
functions, like alert, prompt, and
Math.random, to do work in your programs.

Using built-in functions means using existing
code you don’t have to write yourself.

It’s a good idea to organize your code so
your functions are together, and your global
variables are together, at the top of your
JavaScript file.
