JavaScript is used to add behavior
to web pages.

Browser engines are much faster at
executing JavaScript than they were
just a few years ago.

Browsers begin executing JavaScript
code as soon as they encounter the
code in the page.

Add JavaScript to your page with the
<script> element.

You can put your JavaScript inline in
the web page, or link to a separate
file containing your JavaScript from
your HTML.

Use the src attribute in the <script>
tag to link to a separate JavaScript
file.

HTML declares the structure and
content of your page; JavaScript
computes values and adds behavior
to your page.

JavaScript programs are made up of
a series of statements.

One of the most common JavaScript
statements is a variable declaration,
which uses the var keyword to
declare a new variable and the
assignment operator, =, to assign a
value to it.

There are just a few rules and
guidelines for naming JavaScript
variables, and it’s important that you
follow them.

Remember to avoid JavaScript
keywords when naming variables.

JavaScript expressions compute
values.

Three common types of expressions
are numeric, string and boolean
expressions.

if/else statements allow you to make
decisions in your code.

while/for statements allow you to
execute code many times by looping.

Use console.log instead of alert to
display messages to the Console.

Console messages should be used
primarily for troubleshooting as users
will most likely never see console
messages.

JavaScript is most commonly found
adding behavior to web pages, but is
also used to script applications like
Adobe Photoshop, OpenOffice and
Google Apps, and is even used as a
server-side programming language.
